This repository hosts a piece of software intended as a memorization aid for the various parts of the constructed language Ithkuil.  It is intended to be used not on its own, but as a supplementary tool within your broader learning of the language.

The software works by having you select a category of the language which you wish to learn, after which it will present you with an endless series of multiple-choice questions regarding the category you selected.  Questions which you answered recently will be given lower priority for selection, especially if you answered them correctly.  You can switch to a different category at any time, and you can set timers for the questions if you want.

The software is intended to be simple.  This means that there are no points systems, no online leaderboards, no formal "lessons".  This gives you, the user, the freedom to use this software in whatever way best suits your method of learning.

The questions are not taken randomly from a massive list; instead, they are procedurally constructed based on information and templates supplied with the program and provided to it at runtime.  This seeks to avoid the issue of questions becoming repetitive.

This is not a big, fancy, professional project.  This is just something I'm doing in my spare time, and I probably won't have much of it to spare on this.  If there's sufficient demand for it, i may choose to professionalize it (and frankly, in the unlikely event that it reaches a certain point, i'll realistically be morally obligated to).
